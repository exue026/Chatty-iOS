# Chatty - Learn new languages by connecting with others!
Chatty is an iOS application that provides a platform for people seeking to learn and improve their literacy skills in the same language to connect and communicate through messaging features. Specifically, users can create an account, choose the language they intend to develop, customize profile information, search for and add contacts, upload posts onto a newsfeed, and view and respond to other users' posts and comments.
## Getting started
The latest version of the application has not been released on the Apple App Store. Be on the lookout though, as it will be deployed soon.
## Stack
This app was written using Swift 4 in Xcode 9 *without* using the storyboard for laying out views. It utilizes the PromiseKit and Firebase pods. See the Chatty-Server repository [here](https://www.google.com) for backend technologies.
